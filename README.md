## Overview

This project showcases the vulnerability research that we conducted on Quick Share, which we presented at DEF CON 32 (2024). Our work reveals critical vulnerabilities and includes tools weâ€™ve developed, including a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack chain tool.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes the tools we developed during our research:

1. [**quick_shell**](./docs/doc_quick_shell.md): Implements the entire RCE chain, overwriting an installer executable downloaded by a victim Windows device with Quick Share.
2. [**quick_sniff**](./docs/doc_quick_sniff.md): A sniffer that captures Quick Share's protocol packets, prints them textually. In addition, for each device in the session, it creates a binary file in our custom format that holds all the sent packets in the order they were sent.
3. [**send_packets**](./docs/doc_send_packets.md): Sends Quick Share's protocol packets. As input, it receives a binary file in our custom format with packets to send (the same format that the quick_sniff tool outputs).
4. [**send_file_with_bypass**](./docs/doc_send_file_with_bypass.md): Exploits the vulnerabilities we reported for Quick Share for Android & Windows that allow sending a file without authorization or acceptance by the receiver, no matter what's the current discovery mode ("Your Devices", "Contacts", or "Everyone")
5. [**force_wifi_connection**](./docs/doc_force_wifi_connection.md): Forces a device with Quick Share to connect to a given WiFi network. If performed against a Windows device with the vulnerable Quick Share version, then it also crashes its Quick Share app, creating a Wi-Fi connection to the given Wi-Fi network that lasts forever.
6. [**quick_fuzz**](./docs/doc_quick_fuzz.md): A fuzzer for Quick Share for Windows. Each fuzzing iteration sends a sequence of offline frames, simulating an entire transfer session.

### Supporting Tools

1. [**pack_packet_flows & parse_packet_flows**](./docs/doc_pack_parse_packet_flows.md)

## Building Tools
